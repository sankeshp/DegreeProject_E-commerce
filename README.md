# E-Commerce Microservices Project

## Overview
This e-commerce project is built using a microservices architecture to provide scalability, flexibility, and robustness. The system is designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience with features like user management, product catalog browsing, order management, secure payments, and real-time notifications.

## Features

1. **User Management**
   - Allows customers to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - Secure handling of user data with encryption.

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authorization ensures secure access to resources.

3. **Product Catalog**
   - Browse, search, and filter products efficiently with optimized queries.

4. **Order Management**
   - Facilitates order placement, tracking, and viewing order history.

5. **Payment Service**
   - Integrates with third-party gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) for secure transaction processing.

6. **Notification Service**
   - Real-time updates through email, SMS, or push notifications.

7. **Service Discovery**
   - **Eureka** ensures seamless communication and dynamic discovery of services.

8. **Caching**
   - **Redis** is used to optimize performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load.

9. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - **Kafka** enables reliable and asynchronous communication among services.

10. **Unit Testing**
    - Comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality and system reliability.

11. **Logging Framework**
    - Logging for traceability, debugging, and efficient system monitoring.
